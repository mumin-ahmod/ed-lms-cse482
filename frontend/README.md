# Education LMS Project

**Course**: CSE 482  
**Faculty**: NHQ  
**Group**: 7  

This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) developed as part of the *Internet and Web Technology* course. The primary goal is to enhance our skills in web design, development, and project management. This includes both frontend and backend development, as well as working with complex SQL queries.

The project integrates various technologies such as PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and AJAX for live search functionality. We also use APIs to extend the systemâ€™s capabilities. Through this project, we aim to gain hands-on experience with building real-world applications, managing both the client and server sides, and improving our coding and database management skills.
